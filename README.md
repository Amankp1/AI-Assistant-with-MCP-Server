# ðŸ§  MCP Interactive Chat with Memory (Groq + LangChain)

This repository contains an asynchronous Python-based interactive memory-enabled chatbot powered by [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [Groq API](https://console.groq.com/), and a modular tool configuration system via `MCPClient`.

ðŸ’¬ The assistant supports contextual memory, external tools (like browser agents), and a CLI chat interface. It uses the powerful `qwen-qwq-32b` model from Groq.
